# Optimizing Ad Campaign: An Analysis of Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)


This project aims to analyze the return on ad spend (ROAS) of an advertising campaign using platforms like Google Ads, Amazon Ads, etc. The analysis involves evaluating the performance of the ads and identifying key metrics such as click-through rate and keyword performance. The goal of this project is to provide insights and recommendations for optimizing the campaign to improve ROAS and generate more revenue for the business.

## Results

- Remove keywords with little return on investment (ROAS <1) because for every dollar paid in advertising, less than one dollar is made in profit. ROAS spend can double from, 1.66 to 3.46.

- Experiment with keywords that have a combination of cheese, dip, cream, free, dairy, fat. For example, dairy free, fat free, lactose free.

- Most keywords with little return on invesment are automatically generated by the add platform (63%). These keywords are generated by considering a number of factors like what users are searching for. Therefore, it can be useful to find new keywords associated with the product. Some of the automated keywords are similar to manual generated keywords like cheese (manual), or cheeze (automated). The recommendation is to monitor the keywords weekly, and explore the possibility of adjusting the seetings when generating keywords, if available.
